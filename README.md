    ðŸ–¨ Machine Go Server ðŸŽ›
</h1>

The main goal of machine-go-server is to provide a reliable system to manage machine access in freelance projects. By avoiding improper sharing, proper use of resources is ensured, increasing security and control over the machines involved.

In addition, the project aims to serve as a learning exercise and practical application of the knowledge acquired in Go. The responsible developer is studying the language and saw in machine-go-server an opportunity to create a real project, putting the learned concepts into practice. With this, he seeks to improve his skills in Go, as well as gain experience in the development of secure and scalable applications.

# ðŸ“° Additional Information

- Machine visualization: machine-go-server offers all the necessary routes for administrators to be able to visualize requested or already authorized machines, allowing a complete view of the state of access.
- Machine validation: Machine validation is based on a unique identifier. If encryption is broken and access is attempted with the same ID on the same day, machine-go-server automatically disables the machine, allowing further analysis or permanent blocking.

# âœ… Requirements

- go1.19.3+
- postgres:13.5+
